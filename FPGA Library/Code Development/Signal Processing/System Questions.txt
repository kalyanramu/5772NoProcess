1) What does the typical inpur signal of system look like? This is important for proper scaling of an FFT

2) What is the dynamic range of the input signal?

3) Are there any simulation models of OCT which are available?

4) How is the logFFT signal truncated for a picture?

5) Does lot of people use GPU for rendering? Do they use OpenGL?
